Browse to Raspberry Pi ip address ‘http://<your-pi-ip>/rfoutlet/ App demo
Now you should be able to power on/off your outlets from a web browser. If you would
like more range you can add an antenna to the transmitter chip. I cut a 12 inch wire
from a cat 5 cable and it worked great. If you would like to schedule the outlets on
or off you could usecrontab. Here is an example to run everyday at 8pm.
